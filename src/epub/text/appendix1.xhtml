			<h2>Appendix 1: The Mandate of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission</h2>
			<h3>Schedule N of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement</h3>
			<p>There is an emerging and compelling desire to put the events of the past behind us so that we can work towards a stronger and healthier future. The truth telling and reconciliation process as part of an overall holistic and comprehensive response to the Indian Residential School legacy is a sincere indication and acknowledgement of the injustices and harms experienced by Aboriginal people and the need for continued healing. This is a profound commitment to establishing new relationships embedded in mutual recognition and respect that will forge a brighter future. The truth of our common experiences will help set our spirits free and pave the way to reconciliation.</p>
			<h4>Principles</h4>
			<p>Through the Agreement, the Parties have agreed that an historic Truth and Reconciliation Commission will be established to contribute to truth, healing and reconciliation.</p>
			<p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will build upon the “Statement of Reconciliation” dated January 7, 1998 and the principles developed by the Working Group on Truth and Reconciliation and of the Exploratory Dialogues (1998-1999). These principles are as follows: accessible; victim-centered; confidentiality (if required by the former student); do no harm; health and safety of participants; representative; public/transparent; accountable; open and honourable process; comprehensive; inclusive, educational, holistic, just and fair; respectful; voluntary; flexible; and forward looking in terms of rebuilding and renewing Aboriginal relationships and the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians.</p>
			<p>Reconciliation is an ongoing individual and collective process, and will require commitment from all those affected including First Nations, Inuit and Métis former Indian Residential School (<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">IRS</abbr>) students, their families, communities, religious entities, former school employees, government and the people of Canada. Reconciliation may occur between any of the above groups.</p>

				<h5>10. Events</h5>
					<p>There are three essential event components to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission: National Events, Community Events and Individual Statement-Taking/ Truth Sharing. The Truth and Reconciliation process will be concluded with a final Closing Ceremony.</p>
					<h6>(A) National Events</h6>
					<p>The national events are a mechanism through which the truth and reconciliation process will engage the Canadian public and provide education about the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">IRS</abbr> system, the experience of former students and their families, and the ongoing legacies of the institutions.</p>
					<p>The Commission shall fund and host seven national events in different regions across the country for the purpose of:</p>
					<ol class="enclosedalpha">
						<li>
							<p>sharing information with/from the communities;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>supporting and facilitating the self empowerment of former <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">IRS</abbr> students and those affected by the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">IRS</abbr> legacy;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>providing a context and meaning for the Common Experience Payment;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>engaging and educating the public through mass communications;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>otherwise achieving its goals.</p>
						</li>
							<p>The Commission shall, in designing the events, include in its consideration the history and demographics of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">IRS</abbr> system.</p>
							<p>National events should include the following common components:</p>
						<li>
							<p>an opportunity for a sample number of former students and families to share their experiences;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an opportunity for some communities in the regions to share their experiences as they relate to the impacts on communities and to share insights from their community reconciliation processes;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an opportunity for participation and sharing of information and knowledge among former students, their families, communities, experts, church and government officials, institutions and the Canadian public;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>ceremonial transfer of knowledge through the passing of individual statement transcripts or community reports/statements. The Commission shall recognize that ownership over <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">IRS</abbr> experiences rests with those affected by the Indian Residential School legacy;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>analysis of the short and long term legacy of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">IRS</abbr> system on individuals, communities, groups, institutions and Canadian society including the intergenerational impacts of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">IRS</abbr> system;</p>
						</li>
						<li>

						</li>
						<li>
							<p>health supports and trauma experts during and after the ceremony for all participants.</p>

					<p>It is intended that the community events will be designed by communities and respond to the needs of the former students, their families and those affected by the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">IRS</abbr> legacy including the special needs of those communities where Indian Residential Schools were located.</p>
					<p>The community events are for the purpose of:</p>
					<ol class="enclosedalpha">
						<li>acknowledging the capacity of communities to develop reconciliation practices;</li>
						<li>developing collective community narratives about the impact of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">IRS</abbr> system on former students, families and communities;</li>
						<li>involving church, former school employees and government officials in the reconciliation process, if requested by communities;</li>
						<li>creating a record or statement of community narratives–including truths, insights and recommendations–for use in the historical research and report, national events, and for inclusion in the research centre;</li>
						<li>educating the public and fostering better relationships with local communities;</li>
						<li>allowing for the participation from high level government and church officials, if requested by communities;</li>
						<li>respecting the goal of witnessing in accordance with Aboriginal principles.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The Commission, during the first stages of the process in consultation with the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">IRSSC</abbr>, shall develop the core criteria and values consistent with the Commission’s mandate that will guide the community processes.</p>
					<p>Within these parameters communities may submit plans for reconciliation processes to the Commission and receive funding for the processes within the limits of the Commission’s budgetary capacity.</p>
					<h6>(C) Individual Statement-Taking/Truth Sharing</h6>
					<p>The Commission shall coordinate the collection of individual statements by written, electronic or other appropriate means.

					<p>The Commission shall provide a safe, supportive and sensitive environment for individual statement-taking/truth sharing.</p>
					<p>The Commission shall not use or permit access to an individual’s statement made in any Commission processes, except with the express consent of the individual.</p>

				<h5>11. Access to Relevant Information</h5>
					<p>In order to ensure the efficacy of the truth and reconciliation process, Canada and the churches will provide all relevant documents in their possession or control to and for the use of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, subject to the privacy interests of an individual as provided by applicable privacy legislation, and subject to and in compliance with applicable privacy and access to information legislation, and except for those documents for which solicitor-client privilege applies and is asserted.</p>
					<p>In cases where privacy interests of an individual exist, and subject to and in compliance with applicable privacy legislation and access to information legislation, researchers for the Commission shall have access to the documents, provided privacy is protected.

					<p>Canada and the churches are not required to give up possession of their original documents to the Commission. They are required to compile all relevant documents in an organized manner for review by the Commission and to provide access to their archives for the Commission to carry out its mandate. Provision of documents does not require provision of original documents. Originals or true copies may be provided or originals may be provided temporarily for copying purposes if the original documents are not to be housed with the Commission.</p>
					<p>Insofar as agreed to by the individuals affected and as permitted by process requirements, information from the Independent Assessment Process (<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">IAP</abbr>), existing litigation and Dispute Resolution processes may be transferred to the Commission for research and archiving purposes.</p>

				<h5>12. National Research Centre</h5>
					<p>A research centre shall be established, in a manner and to the extent that the Commission’s budget makes possible. It shall be accessible to former students, their families and communities, the general public, researchers and educators who wish to include this historic material in curricula.</p>
					<p>For the duration of the term of its mandate, the Commission shall ensure that all materials created or received pursuant to this mandate shall be preserved and archived with a purpose and tradition in keeping with the objectives and spirit of the Commission’s work.</p>
					<p>The Commission shall use such methods and engage in such partnerships with experts, such as Library and Archives Canada, as are necessary to preserve and maintain the materials and documents. To the extent feasible and taking into account the relevant law and any recommendations by the Commission concerning the continued confidentiality of records, all materials collected through this process should be accessible to the public.</p>

				<h5>13. Privacy</h5>
					<p>The Commission shall respect privacy laws, and the confidentiality concerns of participants. For greater certainty:</p>
					<ol class="enclosedalpha">
						<li>any involvement in public events shall be voluntary;</li>
						<li>notwithstanding 2(i), the national events shall be public or in special circumstances, at the discretion of the Commissioners, information may be taken in camera;</li>
						<li>the community events shall be private or public, depending upon the design provided by the community;</li>
						<li>if an individual requests that a statement be taken privately, the Commission shall accommodate;</li>
						<li>documents shall be archived in accordance with legislation.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5>14. Budget and Resources</h5>
					<p>The Commission shall prepare a budget within the first three months of its mandate and submit it to the Minister of Indian Residential Schools Resolution Canada for approval. Upon approval of its budget, it will have full authority to make decisions on spending, within the limits of, and in accordance with, its Mandate, its establishing Order in Council, Treasury Board policies, available funds, and its budgetary capacity.</p>
					<p>The Commission shall ensure that there are sufficient resources allocated to the community events over the five year period. The Commission shall also ensure that a portion of the budget is set aside for individual statement-taking/truth sharing and to archive the Commission’s records and information.</p>
					<p>Institutional parties shall bear the cost of participation and attendance in Commission events and community events, as well as provision of documents. If requested by the party providing the documents, the costs of copying, scanning, digitalizing, or otherwise reproducing the documents will be borne by the Commission.</p>
