## About this document

This project is an attempt to format and typeset *Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future: Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada* from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's existing and freely available PDF download.

## Why EPUB?

It is the belief of this author that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada's report should be as accessible as widely as possible to all Canadians in a variety of formats. With the popularity of e-readers and the affordances available via digital book formats (e.g. 'popover endnotes'), the author of this project feels that making a digital publication of the Commission report summary will provide significant utility and accessibility to all interested readers. A static PDF is simply not designed for a reflowable and accessible experience.

EPUB is a broadly supported public standard for e-reading software with built in support in software available on many operating systems and directly on many hardware e-readers such as Koobo and Nook. Furthermore, this format can be easily converted to other e-reader formats such as Amazon Kindle.

## Current status of this project

Currently this is an initial upload with only the very roughest cut and paste of the text of the PDF. The next steps will involve a massive cleanup of the text as well as adding appropriate file splits and semantic markups.

This project includes the source PDF as well as its extracted images in their original formats and converted to greyscale EPUB-friendly JPEGs. It is not currently packaged in a way that can be immediately read by e-reading software.

## How can I help?

It is anticipated that the several thousand endnotes will require significant manual labour to code correctly and semantically for e-readers in which contributions to a shared google sheet in the future would be gratefully accepted. In addition, helpful proof reading from a variety of readers on a variety of devices or reading applications would be invaluable.
