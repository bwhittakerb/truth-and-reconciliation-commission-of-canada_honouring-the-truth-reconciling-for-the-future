20. The Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See explains its role and function at the United Nations as follows: “The Holy See ... is the central government of the Roman Catholic Church. As such, the Holy See is an institution, which under international law and in practice, has a legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as the juridical equal of a State.... The Holy See maintains full diplomatic relations with one hundred seventy-seven (177) countries out of the one hundred ninety-three (193) member countries of the UN.... The Holy See enjoys *by its own choice* the status of Permanent Observer at the United Nations, rather than of a full Member. This is due primarily to the desire of the Holy See to obtain absolute neutrality in specific political problems.” See: UN Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See, “A Short History,” http://www.holyseemission.org/about/history-of-diplomacy-of-the-holy-see.aspx (accessed 19 February 2015).

22. For example, in a study of how the doctrine was used to justify colonization, American legal scholar Robert A. Williams Jr. observed that the United States Supreme Court decision issued by Chief Justice John Marshall in 1823 in the case of *Johnson v. McIntosh* 21 U.S. 543 (1823), “represents the most influential legal opinion on indigenous peoples’ human rights ever issued by a court of law in the Western world. All the major English-language-speaking settler states adopted Marshall’s understanding of the Doctrine of Discovery and its principle that the first European discoverer of lands occupied by non-Christian tribal savages could claim a superior right to those lands under the European Law of Nations. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand all followed Marshall’s opinion as a precedent for their domestic law on indigenous peoples’ inferior rights to property and control over their ancestral lands.” See: Williams, *Savage Anxieties*, 224.

42. Legal scholar Robert A. Williams Jr. explains the Gus-Wen-Tah or Two-Row Wampum as “a sacred treaty belt ... comprised of a bed of white wampum shell beads symbolizing the sacredness and purity of the treaty agreement between the two sides. Two parallel rows of purple wampum beads that extend down the length of the belt represent the separate paths travelled by the two sides on the same river. Each side travels in its own vessel: the Indians in a birch bark canoe, representing their laws, customs, and ways, and the whites in a ship, representing their laws, customs, and ways.” See: Williams Jr., *Linking Arms Together*, 12–13.

65. Canada, Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, *Report*, 1:8. The Commission adopts the definition of “civic trust” put forward by justice scholar Pablo de Greiff as it relates to the role of apologies in reconciliation processes: “Trust involves an expectation of ... commitment to the norms and values we share ... not the thick form of trust characteristic of relations between intimates, but rather ‘civic’ trust ... that can develop among citizens who are strangers to one another, but who are members of the same political community.... Trusting an institution, then, amounts to knowing that its constitutive rules, values, and norms are shared by participants and that they regard them as binding.... Reconciliation, minimally, is the condition under which citizens can trust one another as citizens again (or anew).... It presupposes that both institutions and persons can become *trustworthy*, and this is not something that is merely granted but *earned*.” See: de Greiff, “Role of Apologies,” 125–127.

At each event in or near the Learning Place, the Settlement Agreement churches also organized a Churches Listening Area. The intent was to provide an opportunity for those Survivors who wished to do so to speak personally with a church representative about their residential school experience. When requested, church representatives also offered apologies to Survivors.

182. The Commission’s definition of “public memory” is based on the work of historians who study public memory. For example, James Opp and John C. Walsh define “public memory” as “memories that are made, experienced, and circulated in public spaces and that are intended to be communicated and shared,” See: Opp and Walsh, *Placing Memory*, 9. John Bodnar says that “public memory” is “a body of beliefs and ideas about the past that help [sic] a public or society understand both [sic] its past, present, and by implication, its future,” See: Bodnar, *Remaking America*, 15.
183. Historian W. James Booth makes this important point in his study of how communities of memory are established, maintained, or disrupted through everyday habits and practices. See: Booth, *Communities of Memory*, 45.
184. In its report “Strengthening Indigenous Rights through Truth Commissions: A Practitioner’s Resource,” the International Center for Transitional Justice identifies four thematic areas where commissions must rethink widely held assumptions in the field of transitional justice in order to become more responsive to Indigenous rights. These include: a) moving beyond a state-centric approach; b) moving beyond an individualistic form of analysis; c) moving beyond a focus only on recent violations; and d) moving beyond an overreliance on archival and written sources.
