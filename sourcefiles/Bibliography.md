3. The mandate of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is listed under Schedule N of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, http://www.residentialschoolsettlement.ca/ settlement.html (accessed 5 March 2015). In accordance with the TRC’s mandate, the Commission was required to recognize “the significance of Aboriginal oral and legal traditions in its activities,” Schedule N, 4(d); and “witness, support, promote and facilitate truth and reconciliation events at both the national and community levels,” Schedule N, 1(c). The term *witness* “refers to the Aborig- inal principle of ‘witnessing,’” Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, Schedule N, 1(c), n1.

   Aboriginal oral history, legal traditions, and the principle of witnessing have deep historical roots and contemporary relevance for reconciliation. Indigenous law was used to resolve family and community conflict, to establish Treaties among various Indigenous nations, and to negotiate nation-to-nation treaties with the Crown. For a comprehensive history of Aboriginal–Crown Treaty making from contact to the present, see: Miller, *Compact, Contract, Covenant*. The term *witness
   \* is in reference to the Aboriginal principle of witnessing, which varies among First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples. Generally speaking, witnesses are called to be the keepers of history when an event of historic significance occurs. Through witnessing, the event or work that is undertaken is validated and provided legitimacy. The work could not take place without honoured and respected guests to witness it. Witnesses are asked to store and care for the history they witness and to share it with their own people when they return home. For Aboriginal peoples, the act of witnessing these events comes with a great responsibility to remember all the details and be able to recount them accurately as the foundation of oral histories. See: Thomas, “Honouring the Oral Traditions,” 243–244.

Commission activities

1. In this context, the Commission defines a “visit” as one person attending one day of one National Event. The Commission made daily attendance estimates of its National Events but did not attempt to track those individuals who attended more than one day of any single National Event.
2. Schedule N to the Settlement Agreement provides at section 1(e) that one of the goals of the Com- mission is to “identify sources and create as complete an historical record as possible of the IRS system and legacy.” In addition, section 11 of Schedule N provides that “Canada and the churches will provide all relevant documents in their possession or control to and for the use of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission” and that Canada and the churches are required to “compile all relevant documents in an organized manner for review by the Commission and to provide access to their archives for the Commission to carry out its mandate.”

appeals. Based on preliminary documents filed by the Catholic entities, it appears that they intend to argue that no notice period should be ordered and that the IAP documents cannot be archived without the consent of alleged perpetrators and other persons of interest. The Commission intends to appear before the Court of Appeal of Ontario to argue that the IAP documents cannot be de- stroyed without consulting IAP claimants.

1. The Commission’s engagement with the United Nations included participation at the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the Expert Panel on Indigenous Issues, an Expert Seminar on Truth Commissions and Access to Justice, and a Human Rights Council Special Panel on Education and Teaching History.

11. For example, a 1936 United Church document on First Nations education policy stated that the staff of all United Church schools should be composed of people who had a “Christian motive,
     or, in other words, a missionary purpose coupled with skill in some particular field to teach
     his specialty to the Indians.” Staff members were expected to be “closely related to and actively interested in the work of the nearest United Church,” and be acquainted with, and sympathetic to, “the religious education programme of the United Church.” Having laid out these fairly specific requirements, the policy document added that “some minimum educational qualifications for staff members should be outlined.” TRC, NRA, United Church Archives, Acc. 83.050C, box 144-21, “Statement of Policy Re Indian Residential Schools,” June 1936.

 Reid, “Roman Catholic Foundations,” 5.
 The Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See explains its role and function at the United

Nations as follows: “The Holy See ... is the central government of the Roman Catholic Church.
 As such, the Holy See is an institution, which under international law and in practice, has a legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as the juridical equal of a State.... The Holy See maintains full diplomatic relations with one hundred seventy-seven (177) countries out of the one hundred ninety-three (193) member countries of the UN.... The Holy See enjoys *by its own choice* the status of Permanent Observer at the United Nations, rather than of a full Member. This is due primarily to the desire of the Holy See to obtain absolute neutrality in specific political problems.” See: UN Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See, “A Short History,” http://www.holyseemis- sion.org/about/history-of-diplomacy-of-the-holy-see.aspx (accessed 19 February 2015).

For example, in a study of how the doctrine was used to justify colonization, American legal schol- ar Robert A. Williams Jr. observed that the United States Supreme Court decision issued by Chief Justice John Marshall in 1823 in the case of *Johnson v. McIntosh* 21 U.S. 543 (1823), “represents the most influential legal opinion on indigenous peoples’ human rights ever issued by a court of law
 in the Western world. All the major English-language-speaking settler states adopted Marshall’s understanding of the Doctrine of Discovery and its principle that the first European discoverer of lands occupied by non-Christian tribal savages could claim a superior right to those lands under the European Law of Nations. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand all followed Marshall’s opinion as a precedent for their domestic law on indigenous peoples’ inferior rights to property and control over their ancestral lands.” See: Williams, *Savage Anxieties*, 224.

Legal scholar Robert A. Williams Jr. explains the Gus-Wen-Tah or Two-Row Wampum as “a sacred treaty belt ... comprised of a bed of white wampum shell beads symbolizing the sacredness and purity of the treaty agreement between the two sides. Two parallel rows of purple wampum beads that extend down the length of the belt represent the separate paths travelled by the two sides on the same river. Each side travels in its own vessel: the Indians in a birch bark canoe, representing their laws, customs, and ways, and the whites in a ship, representing their laws, customs, and ways.” See: Williams Jr., *Linking Arms Together*, 12–13.

Canada, Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, *Report*, 1:8. The Commission adopts the definition of “civic trust” put forward by justice scholar Pablo de Greiff as it relates to the role of apologies in reconciliation processes: “Trust involves an expectation of ... commitment to the norms and values we share ... not the thick form of trust characteristic of relations between inti- mates, but rather ‘civic’ trust ... that can develop among citizens who are strangers to one another, but who are members of the same political community.... Trusting an institution, then, amounts to knowing that its constitutive rules, values, and norms are shared by participants and that they re- gard them as binding.... Reconciliation, minimally, is the condition under which citizens can trust one another as citizens again (or anew).... It presupposes that both institutions and persons can become *trustworthy*, and this is not something that is merely granted but *earned*.” See: de Greiff, “Role of Apologies,” 125–127.

In the Learning Places at National Events, there were information posters on the schools in the region, the Legacy of Hope Foundation exhibit, an information booth on the Missing Children Project, interactive maps, and a writing wall where people could offer their personal reflections.
 At each event in or near the Learning Place, the Settlement Agreement churches also organized a Churches Listening Area. The intent was to provide an opportunity for those Survivors who wished to do so to speak personally with a church representative about their residential school experience. When requested, church representatives also offered apologies to Survivors.

 The right of Indigenous peoples to observe traditional spiritual practices is upheld by the United

Nations. Article 12:1 of the *United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples* says, “Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practice, develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies; the right to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites; the right to use and control of their ceremonial objects; and the right to the repatriation of their human remains.” See: United Nations, *Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples*, http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf.

 The decisions state that “the laws of evidence must be adapted in order that this type of evidence

be accommodated and placed on an equal footing with the types of historic evidence that courts are familiar with, which largely consists of historical documents.” See: Reasons for Decision, *Del- gamuukw v.

TRC, AVS, Jessica Bolduc, Statement to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, Edmonton, Alberta, 30 March 2014, Statement Number: ABNE401.

The Commission’s definition of “public memory” is based on the work of historians who study public memory. For example, James Opp and John C. Walsh define “public memory” as “memo- ries that are made, experienced, and circulated in public spaces and that are intended to be com-

municated and shared,” See: Opp and Walsh, *Placing Memory*, 9. John Bodnar says that “public memory” is “a body of beliefs and ideas about the past that help [sic] a public or society under- stand both [sic] its past, present, and by implication, its future,” See: Bodnar, *Remaking America*, 15.

Historian W. James Booth makes this important point in his study of how communities of memory are established, maintained, or disrupted through everyday habits and practices. See: Booth, *Com- munities of Memory*, 45.

In its report “Strengthening Indigenous Rights through Truth Commissions: A Practitioner’s Resource,” the International Center for Transitional Justice identifies four thematic areas where commissions must rethink widely held assumptions in the field of transitional justice in order to become more responsive to Indigenous rights. These include: a) moving beyond a state-centric approach; b) moving beyond an individualistic form of analysis; c) moving beyond a focus only
 on recent violations; and d) moving beyond an overreliance on archival and written sources. See: International Center for Transitional Justice, “Strengthening Indigenous Rights,” 3–5, https://www. ictj.org/sites/default/files/ICTJ-Truth-Seeking-Indigenous-Rights-2012-English.pdf.

26. Indian Residential Schools of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement 2011, IRS School Chart – INAC 2011, document provided to the TRC by Aboriginal and Northern Affairs Canada, 29 September 2011. In 1987, Indian Affairs informed the Blue Quills administration that it

would not provide funding for the high school program after June 1988. The decision was driven, at least in part, by the desire of other local First Nations to develop their own high school programs. Indian Affairs continued to fund post-secondary programs at Blue Quills. The high school program and associated residence closed in June 1988. That year, seventy-six Grade Twelve students graduated from the school: the largest graduating class in the high school’s twelve-year history.
