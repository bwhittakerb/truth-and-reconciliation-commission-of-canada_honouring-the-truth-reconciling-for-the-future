44. Indian Residential Schools of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement 2011, IRS School Chart – INAC 2011, document provided to the TRC by Aboriginal and Northern Affairs Canada, 29 September 2011. In 1987, Indian Affairs informed the Blue Quills administration that it would not provide funding for the high school program after June 1988. The decision was driven, at least in part, by the desire of other local First Nations to develop their own high school programs. Indian Affairs continued to fund post-secondary programs at Blue Quills. The high school program and associated residence closed in June 1988. That year, seventy-six Grade Twelve students graduated from the school: the largest graduating class in the high school’s twelve-year history.
