For example, a 1936 United Church document on First Nations education policy stated that the staff of all United Church schools should be composed of people who had a “Christian motive,  or, in other words, a missionary purpose coupled with skill in some particular field to teach  his specialty to the Indians.” Staff members were expected to be “closely related to and actively interested in the work of the nearest United Church,” and be acquainted with, and sympathetic to, “the religious education programme of the United Church.” Having laid out these fairly specific requirements, the policy document added that “some minimum educational qualifications for staff members should be outlined.” TRC, NRA, United Church Archives, Acc. 83.050C, box 144-21, “Statement of Policy Re Indian Residential Schools,” June 1936.
